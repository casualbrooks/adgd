albuquerque game dev guild

We are building a website:
(Instead of a grandiose crazy thing, a thing we can digest, that may later grow)

All it needs to have...

### add a AGDG member profile, a member has:
- a name
- a short description
- a photo (or maybe some sort of avatar)
- a website
- games they are part of
- "classes" (artist, dev, music, video, marketing, etc.)  

### add a game, a game has:
- a name
- a short description
- a screenshot (of a particular size)
- a website
- a video (optional)
- links to members
- progress through achievements
- progress bar
  
### add Achievements:
- art, concept
- art, completed
- concept, narrative
- concept, mechanics
- concept, prototype
- game, alpha done
- game, beta done
- game, playable
- game, balance
- marketing, website
- marketing, video
- music/sound effects

### other Ideas:

#### avatar generation
- retro/pixel style
- custom faces / hair / clothing accessories
- avatar's have classes
- avatar's have levels, experience (the more games someone works in, the more achievements they get)

#### fake money 
- people (in guild and outside of guild) get coins/gems/things
- they can assign to game projects as a form of voting for the things they want to see completed
- possibly game devs can also put up polls that people can then vote with their fake money things in to help direct the game development (vote for levels, character classes in games, additional content packs,...)
